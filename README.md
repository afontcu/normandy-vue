# Vue CSS Objects

A WIP collection of OOCSS Objects written in Vue.

## Installation
---------------
``` bash
npm install --save vue-css-objects
```

## Usage
---------------
``` javascript
import { Media }Â from 'vue-css-objects'
```

This package provides the necessary CSS styles to render each object properly,
but it's not mandatory to import them: you can use whatever style provider
you want to use. Just make sure to map correctly all the classes generated by `vue-css-objects`.

If you still want to import our generated CSS syles just add

``` javascript
require('vue-css-objects/dist/lib/vue-css-objects.min.css')
```

to your application entry point.
